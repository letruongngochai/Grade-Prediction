## MOTIVATIONS
In today's educational environment, assessing students' abilities and potential plays an important role in the education and recruitment process.
- For schools: Predicting student learning outcomes in the next semester can help schools evaluate the effectiveness of training programs, helping schools identify potential problems if the number is large. Students whose academic results suddenly decline, immediately come up with solutions to improve the quality of teaching.
- For businesses: Helps employers have more information to evaluate students' abilities and talents more accurately.
- For academic advisors and students: Early detect and analyze problems in the next semester for some students with low predicted results to promptly pay attention and make reasonable study plans.
With awareness of this problem, we have chosen the problem of predicting students' average scores in the next semesters to learn and carry out the final topic. Our goal is to survey and analyze to find better ways to exploit data for efficiency and models to achieve high results on the given problem. To achieve this goal, we approach the problem by applying preprocessing methods, analyzing data, and performing comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.
